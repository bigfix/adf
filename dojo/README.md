Sample dojo dashboard
---------------------

This sample dashboard shows an example of using dojo.

To maintain no nested folder structure, all files under dojo library are
archived under the file dojo_1.5.1_WTED_1100.besarchive. This file is extracted
when the dashboard is loaded into console by using utility functions under ADF
tem.library namespace.

See ADF Developerâ€™s Guide to know more about dojo dashboard and the use of
besarchive approach.
